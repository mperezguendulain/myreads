# Project Overview
The MyReads project, it's the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
I created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application. Udacity provided me an API server and client library that I used to persist information and this way the user can interact with the application.
The project use funtional components with React hooks. Feel free to comment me any sugetion you have.
